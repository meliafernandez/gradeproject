# gradeproject
Gives students an estimate of their final grade based on their current scores.
This program will take their scores for both homework sources and calculate the homework category score. It will also have them enter their scores for the other grading categories and have them estimate what they believe they will score on remaining exams. It will then estimate the final grade.
